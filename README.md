# Link-Prediction-with-NASA-GES-DISC-Dataset
• The NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) has developed a knowledge graph to enhance dataset discovery and research reproducibility.
• This graph connects various entities such as datasets, publications, instruments, platforms, authors, and science keywords, facilitating improved navigation and understanding of the relationships between these components.
• By integrating machine learning techniques like link prediction, we can identify missing associations between datasets and science keywords. This approach enhances metadata completeness, thereby improving dataset discoverability.
• Additionally, by utilizing GNN’s with RAG one can augment and enrich recommendations with more relevant content.
